Amended force push
The git commit command accepts a --amend option which will update the previous commit. A commit is often amended to update the commit message or add new changes. Once a commit is amended a git push will fail because Git will see the amended commit and the remote commit as diverged content. The --force option must be used to push an amended commit.

# make changes to a repo and git add
git commit --amend
# update the existing commit message
git push --force origin main
The above example assumes it is being executed on an existing repository with a commit history. git commit --amend is used to update the previous commit. The amended commit is then force pushed using the --force option. -->
